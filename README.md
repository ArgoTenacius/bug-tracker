# About the project
This was a TOP (the odin project) project made with react js, react icons, react router and firebase. The objective was to build a web app which had and use a database, in this case, firebase. In this web app you will need first to pass by the auth (authentication) page, to then be able to choose an existent project (if you are in the project) or to create a new one. Inside of the project you have the bug page, which you can add tasks/bugs and set between three stages (open, in progress and done) and the user page, where you can add new users by their email into your project.

# How to improve/Features to add
1. Add an archive page and a way to archive tasks/bugs.
2. Add priority sort and aesthetic to the tasks/bugs.
3. Add a real time database.
4. Add a drag and drop tasks/bugs feature.
5. Add more details to the tasks/bugs card.
